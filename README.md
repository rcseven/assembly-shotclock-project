#Basketball Shot Clock using 8051 Microcontroller

This project involves designing and building an electronic shot clock for basketball games using an 8051 microcontroller. The shot clock will display the remaining time for the attacking team, automatically reset to 14 seconds if the ball touches the rim, and manually reset to 24 seconds when the opposing team gains possession. It will feature buttons for user input, 7-segment displays, and a buzzer for output. The 8051 microcontroller will be programmed in both Assembly and C to manage timekeeping and user inputs. The project also includes developing a user-friendly interface and packaging for the shot clock. The final system will be reliable, accurate, and meet the standards for official basketball games, combining hardware design, programming, and user interface development.
